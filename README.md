# lyrinka_OS
The lyrinka operating system for Cortex - M3 MCUs. 
lyrinka operating system is an extremely lightweight operating system. 
The unique feature is that its scheduler is a process, not inside the kernel. 
The project is for me and my friends, we wish for a more simple OS for our projects. 
It is so important to me, so I named this pretty library after me.
